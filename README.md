# Kubernetes

This repository contains a collection of playbooks and other scripts that are referenced in my series on Ansible on my [Blog](http://leftasexercise.com/ "Blog"). Roughly, the contents are organized as follows:

* Part I: Basics, this directory contains just a few scripts to quickly bring up test environments
* Part II: This post introduces ad-hoc commands with Ansible and various modules (and there is no corresponding directory in this repository)
* Part III: Playbooks, what they are, how they are structured, and instructions to spin up a test environment locally with Vagrant
* Part IV: Variables and facts, templating with Jinja2
* Part V: Working with inventories and using Docker containers as Ansible hosts
* Part VI: Control structures and roles
* Part VII: Using Ansible with cloud providers
* Part VII: Using Ansible with Terraform
