# The second play will wait until all machines are fully established. Here we use the inventory
# that we have just created. Note that we have added the hosts with the SSH settings to the inventory,
# so there is no need to supply the ansible_ssh_private_key_file and ansible_user values
# We initially do not gather facts, as the SSH daemon might still be starting up, but just wait for
# the hosts to come up
